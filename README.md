EU-Cookies-Dialog
=================

Following a revised EU directive on website cookies, each company based, or doing business, in the EU is required to notify users about the cookies used on their website.

This is a practical example of a non intrusive dialogue implementation.

Use this plugin to gain consent through the use of a Dialogue box. This could be shown on the homepage or on each page where a visitor has not opted in to Cookies the site sets.

INSTALLATION
=================
Code explained:

CSS
The CSS file (style.css) contains the styling for the dialog box.
Copy the CSS in style.css to the main css file of site you are working on.

JS
jquery.cookie.js is a simple, lightweight jQuery plugin for reading, writing and deleting cookies.
cookiedialog.js is a simple plugin that will set a cookie when a user clicks the button to accept the use of cookies. It will check if the acceptance cookie have already been set for a website and remove the dialog box.
Installation:
 <script src="jquery.cookie.js"></script>
 <script src="cookiedialog.js"></script>
the above will go in your <head> tag of the main template(s). Donâ€™t forget to include after the jQuery library.
IMPORTANT: DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE COOKIE NAME in cookiedialog.js FROM 'Treat_Digital_cookiesAccepted' TO CLIENT'S NAME - 'Client_Name_cookiesAccepted'.

HTML
This is the dialogue box to alert the user of the new Cookies page. See cookies-dialog.html.
Copy the dialog box html and paste just before the </body> tag.
